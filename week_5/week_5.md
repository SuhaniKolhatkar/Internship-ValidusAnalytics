## Work report : 
<p>
    As an intern at Validus Analytics, my Week 5 work report revolves around the development of the website aspect for our venture. After completing my 12th HSC and CET exams, Mr. Anand Khandekar (CEO of Validus Analytics) and I initiated the idea of providing guidance and support to 11th and 12th-grade students, extending it to engineering students in the field of mathematics. This idea further evolved, leading us to establish Validus Edutech as a development center, which incorporates Students Katta.

During Week 5, my focus was on creating a website that embodied our philosophical thinking and showcased the essence of our venture. I diligently worked on designing and developing the website, ensuring its responsiveness and functionality. One of the crucial aspects of my work involved translating our philosophical concepts into a visually appealing and user-friendly online platform. I carefully selected a suitable color scheme that aligned with our vision and enhanced the overall user experience.

The website serves as a digital hub for Validus Edutech and Students Katta, providing valuable information and resources for students seeking guidance in mathematics and programming. By effectively conveying our philosophy and incorporating it into the website's design, I aimed to create an engaging platform that resonates with our target audience.

Throughout the week, I dedicated my efforts to ensure that the website accurately represented the vision and goals of Validus Edutech. By successfully completing this task, I have contributed to the overall development and branding of our venture, setting the stage for future engagement with students and educators in the field of mathematics education and technological exploration.
